This project is just a fun little side hobby to expand our knowledge and grow our portfolios.

It is based on the popular gambling card game black jack. A user can define the amount of decks used, how the deck is shuffled and how the dealer reacts. Virtual chips are used to track performance and luck.

A statistical report is also avaliable when a user wants to view any game played and the statistics behind it.
